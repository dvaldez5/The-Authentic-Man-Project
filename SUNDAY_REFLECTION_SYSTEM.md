# Sunday Reflection System - The AM Project

## Overview
The AM Project's weekly reflection system is optimized for maximum user engagement by focusing on Sunday as the primary reflection day, when users are most likely to engage in thoughtful self-assessment and goal setting.

## Reflection Window Schedule

### Optimal Engagement Window
- **Saturday 6:00 PM** - **Sunday 11:59 PM**
- Total window: ~30 hours for maximum flexibility
- Peak engagement expected: Sunday afternoon/evening

### Week Structure
- **Reflection Coverage**: Monday - Sunday (completed week)
- **Goal Setting**: For the upcoming Monday - Sunday week
- **Clean Boundaries**: No overlap between reflection periods

## User Experience Flow

### Saturday Evening (6 PM onwards)
- Weekly reflection prompt becomes available
- Users can begin reflecting on their completed Monday-Sunday week
- Early adopters can set goals for the upcoming week

### Sunday (All Day)
- **Primary engagement day** - highest user activity expected
- Full reflection functionality available
- AI-powered goal visualization prompts active
- Optimal time for thoughtful self-assessment

### Monday-Tuesday (Grace Period)
- **Extended window** for users who missed the optimal Sunday timing
- Reflection prompt shows with different messaging: "Catch up on last week's reflection"
- Users can still complete previous week's reflection and set goals for current week
- Maintains engagement rather than forcing users to wait until next weekend

### Wednesday-Friday
- No reflection prompts shown (reflection window closed)
- Users focus on executing their weekly goals
- System tracks progress for next week's reflection
- Clean break period before next Saturday-Sunday window

## Technical Implementation

### Prompt Display Logic
```javascript
// Timezone-adjusted prompt display logic
const now = new Date();
const localTime = new Date(now.getTime() - (5 * 60 * 60 * 1000)); // EST adjustment
const dayOfWeek = localTime.getDay(); // 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, ..., 6 = Saturday
const currentHour = localTime.getHours();

// Saturday from 6 PM onwards - optimal window
if (dayOfWeek === 6 && currentHour >= 18) {
  shouldShow = true;
  windowType = 'optimal';
  message = 'Perfect timing for your weekly reflection!';
}
// All day Sunday - peak engagement
else if (dayOfWeek === 0) {
  shouldShow = true;
  windowType = 'optimal';
  message = 'Perfect timing for your weekly reflection!';
}
// Monday-Tuesday grace period for missed reflections
else if (dayOfWeek === 1 || dayOfWeek === 2) {
  shouldShow = true;
  windowType = 'grace';
  message = 'Catch up on your weekly reflection from this past week.';
}
// Wednesday-Friday (closed window)
else {
  shouldShow = false;
  windowType = 'closed';
  message = 'Reflection window opens Saturday at 6 PM.';
}
```

### Week Boundary Calculation
```javascript
// Monday-Sunday week structure with timezone adjustment
const now = new Date();
const localTime = new Date(now.getTime() - (5 * 60 * 60 * 1000)); // EST adjustment
const startOfWeek = new Date(localTime);
startOfWeek.setDate(localTime.getDate() - localTime.getDay() + 1); // Monday
startOfWeek.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);

const endOfWeek = new Date(startOfWeek);
endOfWeek.setDate(startOfWeek.getDate() + 6); // Sunday
endOfWeek.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);
```
