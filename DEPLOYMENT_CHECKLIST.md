## Important Notes

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: The notification system must respect the 9 AM quiet hours boundary - this is a hard requirement for user experience.

⚠️ **PAYMENT PROCESSING**: Ensure Stripe is properly configured with the correct price ID for $9.99/month subscriptions with 7-day trials.

⚠️ **PWA FUNCTIONALITY**: The app must work seamlessly in both browser and PWA modes, with notifications functioning in both contexts.

✅ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**: Deployment is considered successful when users can register, subscribe, receive notifications, and use the PWA without issues.
