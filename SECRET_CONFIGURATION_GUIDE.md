# Project-Specific Secret Configuration Guide
**Date**: August 19, 2025

## Critical Issue: Analytics Not Working

### Problem
Your Google Analytics measurement ID is incorrect:
- **Current**: G-KGG3MDSXEC ❌ (no data collection)  
- **Correct**: G-YYP7EQ64H4 ✅ (matches your GA4 property)

### Google Ads Configuration Found
- **Google Ads ID**: AW-835937139 ✅ (already configured in system)
- **Conversion Labels**: Configured for newsletter, subscription, contact forms

## How to Fix the Secret for THIS PROJECT ONLY

### Step 1: Access Project Secrets
1. In your Replit workspace, look for the **Secrets** tab (lock icon) in the left sidebar
2. This is project-specific, not account-wide

### Step 2: Update the Measurement ID
1. Find the secret: `VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`
2. Change the value from: `G-KGG3MDSXEC`
3. To the correct value: `G-YYP7EQ64H4`
4. Save the change

### Step 3: Restart the Application
After updating the secret, the app will automatically restart and begin collecting data.
