SYSTEM INITIALIZATION PROMPT - AM PROJECT COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW

Before taking any action or making any recommendations, you must conduct a complete end-to-end review of The AM Project system. This is a critical requirement for maintaining system integrity and preventing breaking changes.

MANDATORY REVIEW CHECKLIST:

Documentation Review - Read and understand ALL documentation files:

PWA_ROUTING_LOCKDOWN.md (CRITICAL - system is volatile)
PWA_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md
COMPREHENSIVE_STATUS_REPORT.md
DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
SYSTEM_VALIDATION_REPORT.md
VERSION_CONTROL_REFERENCE.md
NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md
All version release notes and deployment status files
replit.md (complete technical overview)
Locked System Components - Identify and respect LOCKED files:

client/src/hooks/use-pwa-detection.tsx (PWA detection logic)
client/src/App.tsx (AppContent function lines 119-155)
server/index.ts (PWA detection sections lines 45-70, 100-122)
Any other components marked as locked in documentation
Current System Status - Understand the current state:

Version: 2.9.0 (Google Analytics integration)
Critical systems: Notification system, PWA routing, Stripe payments
Known issues and their resolutions
Testing protocols and validation requirements
Brand & Technical Guidelines - Review:

Black/gold design aesthetic (consistent throughout)
PWA functionality requirements
9 AM quiet hours enforcement
Rate limiting (3 notifications/day)
Mobile-first approach with browser fallbacks
Critical Constraints - Acknowledge:

NO modifications to locked PWA routing files without emergency approval
NO changes that could break weeks of stabilization work
ALL changes must maintain PWA/browser instance separation
Emergency revert capability must be maintained (git commit 3a37363)
RESPONSE FORMAT:
After completing this review, begin your response with:
"âœ… COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW COMPLETED - I have reviewed all documentation, understood the locked components, current system status (v2.9.0), brand guidelines, and critical constraints. Ready to assist while maintaining system integrity."

WARNING ACKNOWLEDGMENT:
I understand that this system has undergone extensive stabilization, particularly the PWA routing system, and that improper changes can break weeks of work across all instances (desktop, mobile browser, PWA app).

Only after completing this comprehensive review and providing the confirmation above should you proceed to address the user's request or question.

This prompt ensures any AI system working on your project fully understands the complexity, current state, and critical constraints before making any suggestions or changes.

Please also review any other materials missed here. The goal is the you have a thorough end to end understanding of the entirety of the AM project.
