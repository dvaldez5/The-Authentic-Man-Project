## GA4 Dashboard Metrics

### Primary KPIs
1. **Bounce Rate by Page:** Identify highest bounce pages
2. **Conversion Funnel Drop-off:** Stage-by-stage analysis
3. **Engagement Depth Score:** User quality assessment
4. **Time to Bounce:** Speed of exit decisions

3. **Form Abandonment:** Field-level drop-off analysis
4. **Device/Source Analysis:** Platform-specific behavior

## Data Collection Points

### Automatic Tracking
- Page views with enhanced context
- Scroll depth (25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 100%)
- Time milestones (5s, 15s, 30s, 60s, 120s, 300s)
- Exit intent detection
- Session behavior patterns

### Manual Event Tracking
- CTA button clicks
- Form field interactions
- Content section views
- Navigation actions
- Chat/support interactions

## Bounce Risk Assessment Algorithm

### Risk Calculation
```
High Risk: timeOnPage < 15s AND scrollDepth < 25% AND interactions = 0
Medium Risk: timeOnPage < 30s OR scrollDepth < 50% OR interactions < 2
Low Risk: timeOnPage > 60s AND scrollDepth > 50% AND interactions > 2
```

### Engagement Score Formula
```
Score = (duration * 0.3) + (pageViews * 0.2) + (scrollVelocity * 0.1) + 
        (interactionRate * 0.3) + (contentConsumption * 0.1)
```
