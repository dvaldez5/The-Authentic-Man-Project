### What We're About to Change

**Planned Migration:** Subdomain separation for Google Play Store readiness
- Marketing pages stay at `theamproject.com`
- Member app moves to `app.theamproject.com`
- Gradual migration: Dashboard ‚Üí Journal ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Challenges ‚Üí Auth

**GoDaddy DNS Setup (Ready):**
- Type: A Record
- Name: app
- Value: 34.23.200.227
- TTL: 600

### EMERGENCY RECOVERY PROCEDURE

If the subdomain migration breaks the application:

1. **STOP ALL CHANGES IMMEDIATELY**
2. **Verify this backup state is working:**
   ```bash
   # Test marketing pages
   curl -I https://theamproject.com
   curl -I https://theamproject.com/join
   
   # Test member pages (with auth)
   curl -I https://theamproject.com/dashboard
   ```

3. **If needed, revert code changes:**
   - PWA detection logic: Revert `client/src/hooks/use-pwa-detection.tsx`
   - Routing: Revert `client/src/App.tsx`
   - Server config: Revert `server/index.ts`

4. **Test critical functionality:**
   - User registration/login
   - Subscription payments
   - PWA installation on mobile
   - Daily challenges and journal
   - Notification delivery
