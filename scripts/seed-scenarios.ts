      },
      {
        text: "Cancel the gym. Stay home to talk.",

    options: [
      {
        text: "Stay late without saying anything.",

      },
      {
        text: "Say you have a commitment and leave.",
        feedback: "You honored your word, but without context, this might create workplace tension. Boundaries matter, but so does how you set them."

      {
        text: "Explain the commitment and offer an alternative.",

    options: [
      {
        text: "Listen like always. He needs support.",

        text: "Just this once won't hurt anything.",

      },
      {
        text: "Put the phone in another room and go to sleep.",

        text: "Say 'I'm fine, buddy' and change the subject.",

      },
      {
        text: "Explain all your problems so he understands.",

        text: "Say 'Dad's working through some tough stuff, but I'm okay.'",

    options: [
      {
        text: "Say what you're thinking. She started it.",
        feedback: "You chose winning over loving. Those words can't be taken back. Relationships die not from big betrayals, but from small cruelties that accumulate over time."
      },
      {
        text: "Walk away without saying anything.",
