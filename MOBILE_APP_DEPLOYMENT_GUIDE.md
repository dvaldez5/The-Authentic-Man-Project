## Important Considerations

### Content Policy Compliance

**Google Play Store:**
- Ensure subscription handling complies with billing policies
- Mental health content must be responsible and not medical advice
- Include appropriate disclaimers about professional mental health services

**Apple App Store:**
- PWAs must provide significant functionality beyond website wrapper
- Subscription must use Apple's In-App Purchase system (may require code changes)
- Mental health content review may be stricter

### Technical Requirements

**Both Stores:**
- App must function offline (your service worker handles this)
- Performance must be responsive and smooth
- No broken links or missing content
- Proper handling of device permissions (notifications, etc.)

### Alternative Professional Services

**If You Prefer Professional Help:**
- **MobiLoud**: Full-service PWA-to-app conversion with guaranteed approval ($2,000-5,000)
- **PWA2APK**: Automated conversion service ($99-299)
- **AppMySite**: DIY platform with app store submission help ($50-200/month)

## Timeline Expectations

**Google Play Store:** 1-2 weeks total

- Release: Immediate after approval

**Apple App Store:** 2-4 weeks total
- Setup: 3-7 days (includes Xcode work)

## Post-Launch Considerations

1. **Update Strategy**
   - Web updates automatically reflect in apps (PWA benefit)
   - Major changes may require new app store submissions
   - Monitor app store reviews and respond promptly

2. **Analytics Integration**
   - Your existing Google Analytics will track app usage
   - Consider adding app-specific tracking for store metrics
   - Monitor app store performance dashboards

3. **Marketing**
   - Include app store badges on your website
   - Update marketing materials to mention mobile apps
   - Consider app store optimization (ASO) strategies
