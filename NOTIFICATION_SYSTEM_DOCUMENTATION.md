# Advanced Notification System Documentation

## Overview

The AM Project features a comprehensive, production-ready notification system designed to drive user engagement through intelligent, personalized messaging. The system respects user preferences, optimizes delivery timing, and provides detailed analytics for continuous improvement.

**STATUS: FULLY FUNCTIONAL ON MOBILE (as of June 23, 2025)**
- Live testing confirmed: Scheduled notifications working on mobile PWA instances
- Root cause fixed: Backend notification settings + API dependency issues resolved
- All notification types operational: Daily challenges, weekly reflections, user engagement

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Notification Scheduler** (`client/src/lib/notification-scheduler.ts`)
   - Central orchestration of all notification timing and delivery
   - Handles quiet hours (10 PM - 9 AM) with automatic rescheduling
   - Implements rate limiting and retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Manages notification templates and personalization

2. **Content Generator** (`client/src/lib/notification-content.ts`)
   - A/B testing framework for notification content optimization
   - Dynamic content generation based on user context
   - Weighted random selection for testing variations
   - Performance tracking for content effectiveness

3. **Analytics System** (`client/src/lib/notification-analytics.ts`)
   - Comprehensive event tracking (sent, clicked, dismissed, failed)
   - A/B test result analysis and reporting
   - Engagement rate calculations and performance metrics
   - Automatic cleanup of old data (30-day retention)

4. **Lifecycle Management** (`client/src/hooks/use-notification-lifecycle.tsx`)
   - Service worker integration and message handling
   - Performance monitoring with health checks
   - Automatic cleanup scheduling and optimization
   - Visibility-based performance tuning

5. **Priority Manager** (`client/src/lib/notification-priority.ts`)
   - Context-aware notification prioritization
   - PWA vs browser mode detection and handling
   - Intelligent scheduling based on user activity patterns

## Features

### Smart Timing
- **Quiet Hours**: No notifications between 10 PM - 9 AM in user's timezone
- **Morning Rescheduling**: Blocked notifications automatically scheduled for 9 AM
- **Activity-Based Timing**: Notifications timed based on user engagement patterns
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 3 notifications per day per user
- **Mobile PWA Support**: Full functionality confirmed on mobile Progressive Web App instances
- **Default Settings**: New users have notifications enabled by default (`enableBrowserNotifications: true`)

### Personalization
- **Context-Aware Content**: Messages adapt to user progress, streaks, and activity
- **Dynamic Timing**: Different messaging for morning, afternoon, and evening
- **User Journey Awareness**: Content changes based on user lifecycle stage
- **Streak Protection**: Special handling for users at risk of losing streaks

### Reliability
- **Exponential Backoff**: Failed notifications retry with increasing delays (5min, 15min, 45min)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error tracking and recovery
- **Permission Management**: Graceful handling of permission states
- **Service Worker Integration**: Reliable delivery even when app is closed

### Analytics & Optimization
- **A/B Testing**: Multiple content variations tested automatically
- **Performance Metrics**: Success rates, engagement rates, click-through rates
- **Health Monitoring**: System status checks and performance warnings
- **Content Analytics**: Track which messages perform best

## Notification Types

### 1. Daily Challenge (`daily-challenge`)
- **Purpose**: Encourage daily engagement with challenges
- **Timing**: 9 AM - 8 PM, respecting quiet hours
- **Content Variations**: 4 different motivational approaches
- **Personalization**: Adapts to time of day and user streak

### 2. Streak Protection (`streak-protection`)
- **Purpose**: Prevent users from losing active streaks
- **Timing**: High priority, can override some restrictions
- **Urgency**: Requires user interaction
- **Personalization**: Shows current streak count and motivation

### 3. Habit Nudge (`habit-nudge`)
- **Purpose**: Reinforce positive habit formation
- **Timing**: Based on user's historical activity patterns
- **Content**: Varies by streak status and user type
- **Frequency**: Maximum once per day

### 4. Course Reminder (`course-reminder`)
- **Purpose**: Re-engage users who've paused learning
- **Timing**: 24-48 hours after last course activity
- **Personalization**: Shows progress percentage and course name
- **Content**: Encouraging continuation messaging

### 5. Scenario Reminder (`scenario-reminder`)
- **Purpose**: Prompt engagement with decision-making scenarios
- **Timing**: Varied to prevent predictability
- **Content**: 4 rotating variations focusing on real-world application
- **Engagement**: Designed to drive immediate action

### 6. Re-engagement (`re-engagement`)
- **Purpose**: Bring back inactive users
- **Timing**: After 3-7 days of inactivity
- **Personalization**: Content varies by time away from platform
- **Approach**: Non-pushy, value-focused messaging

## Configuration

### User Settings
Users can control their notification experience through Settings:

- **Browser Notifications**: Master on/off toggle
- **Daily Challenge Reminders**: Enable/disable daily challenges
- **Habit Tracking**: Streak and habit reminder preferences
- **Scenario Prompts**: Decision-making scenario notifications
- **Weekly Reflections**: Reflection reminder timing
- **Timezone**: Automatic detection with manual override option

### System Configuration
Key configuration options in the notification scheduler:

```typescript
// Quiet hours (10 PM to 9 AM)
private quietHours = { start: 22, end: 9 };

// Rate limiting (max 3 per day)
private dailyLimit = 3;

// Retry attempts (max 3 with exponential backoff)
private maxRetries = 3;
```

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/notification-settings` - User notification preferences
- `GET /api/user-activity` - Activity patterns and streak data
- `GET /api/auth/me` - User profile information
- `PUT /api/notification-settings` - Update user preferences

### Data Flow
1. System loads user preferences and activity data
2. Notification scheduler evaluates timing and eligibility
3. Content generator creates personalized message
4. Delivery system sends notification via service worker
5. Analytics system tracks delivery and engagement
6. Performance data feeds back into optimization

## Testing

### Testing Interface
The system includes a comprehensive testing interface accessible in Settings:

- **Direct Notification Test**: Immediate notification with permission check
- **Scheduled Tests**: Test each notification type individually
- **System Status**: Real-time health monitoring
- **Performance Metrics**: Success rates, engagement data
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Detailed breakdown by notification type

### Test Scenarios
1. **Permission States**: Test granted, denied, and default permissions
2. **Quiet Hours**: Verify blocking and rescheduling behavior
3. **Content Variations**: Validate A/B testing implementation
4. **Error Handling**: Test retry logic and failure recovery
5. **Analytics**: Confirm tracking accuracy and data integrity

## Deployment Considerations

   - Check for notification fatigue (rate limiting)

3. **System Performance Issues**
   - Monitor success rates and retry patterns
   - Check for excessive scheduled notifications
   - Verify cleanup processes are running

#### Debug Tools
